**Note:** Replace ```j4k``` ```:author_username``` ```https://j.ackwall.io``` ```jw@jack.gd``` ```api``` ```:package_description``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
